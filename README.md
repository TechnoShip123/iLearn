# iLearn
A basic repository containing my general Java project for me to self-learn Java (JRE 8)
All of the important stuff are in the `src` folder, so make sure to check that out.
If anyone else is new to Java and looking to learn it, I take notes in most of my code so be sure to look for that as well.
